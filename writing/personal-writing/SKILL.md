## Core Philosophy

Good writing sounds like a specific person talking to another specific person. It has a point of view, makes choices, and occasionally breaks rules on purpose. AI-generated writing fails not because it's inaccurate — it fails because it has no voice, no edges, no fingerprint.

**The standard**: If you removed the author's name, could someone who knows them still identify the writing as theirs? That's the bar.

---

## The Rules

### 1. Lead with the Point

State the conclusion, recommendation, or ask in the first sentence. No throat-clearing. No "In today's rapidly evolving landscape..." openers.

- **Bad**: "As we continue to navigate the complexities of the HVAC market, it's worth considering the potential impact of seasonal demand patterns on our revenue trajectory."
- **Good**: "Summer installs will drop 20% if we don't lock in contracts by April. Here's the fix."

### 2. Write Like You Talk

Read every sentence aloud. If you wouldn't say it in a meeting, don't write it. Use contractions. Start sentences with "And," "But," "So." Use fragments when they hit harder.

- Use "we're" not "we are," "don't" not "do not," "can't" not "cannot"
- Short sentences for emphasis. Long ones when you're building an argument and need the reader to follow a chain of logic through to the end.
- One-word sentences. Fine.

### 3. Be Specific, Not Impressive

Replace every vague claim with a concrete detail. Numbers, names, dates, examples. Specificity is what separates writing that persuades from writing that fills space.

- **Vague**: "We've seen significant improvement in key metrics across multiple service areas."
- **Specific**: "Conversion jumped from 31% to 44% in three weeks. Biggest gains were in duct replacements."

### 4. Take a Position

Don't hedge everything. If the answer is "yes," say yes. If Option B is better, say Option B is better and why. Hedging reads as either AI-generated or as someone covering their ass.

- **Hedging**: "It could potentially be beneficial to consider exploring the possibility of..."
- **Direct**: "Do this. Here's why."

Reserve qualifiers for genuinely uncertain situations. When you do qualify, be specific about what you don't know: "We don't have Q2 data yet, but based on Q1 the trend holds."

### 5. Vary the Rhythm

Monotone sentence length is the biggest structural tell of AI writing. Mix it up deliberately:

- Follow a long explanatory sentence with a short punch.
- Use a fragment after a complex thought. Like this.
- Let some paragraphs be one sentence. Let others be five.
- Don't start three consecutive sentences the same way.

### 6. Show the Thinking, Not Just the Answer

When explaining reasoning, show the actual decision path — including what you considered and rejected. This is how humans actually communicate expertise.

- **AI pattern**: "The optimal approach involves leveraging a multi-faceted strategy encompassing..."
- **Human pattern**: "We looked at three options. Outsourcing was cheapest but the quality risk kills it. In-house training takes too long. The hybrid model costs 15% more but gets us live in 6 weeks."

### 7. Use Real Transitions, Not Signpost Words

Don't connect ideas with "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally," "It's worth noting that." These are AI filler. Instead, use the actual logical connection between ideas.

- **Filler**: "Moreover, it is important to consider the financial implications."
- **Real**: "That changes the math. Here's how."
- **Or just**: Start the next paragraph. If the connection is obvious, you don't need a transition at all.

### 8. Match Tone to Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Board/investor materials | Confident, precise, forward-looking | "We'll hit $15.5M EBITDA by executing three moves." |
| Internal ops/team emails | Direct, practical, action-oriented | "Need this done by Thursday. Here's what 'done' looks like." |
| Customer-facing copy | Warm, competent, no-BS | "Your system's 15 years old. Here's what that means for your energy bill." |
| Sales/proposals | Specific, outcome-focused, conversational | "You asked about timeline. Six weeks, installed and running." |
| SOPs/training | Clear, sequential, example-heavy | "Step 1: Open the ticket. Step 2: Check these three fields..." |

### 9. Kill the Filler

Every sentence should either advance the argument, provide evidence, or prompt action. If a sentence could be deleted without losing meaning, delete it.

Common filler to cut:
- "It's important to note that..." — just state the thing
- "In order to..." — "to" works
- "At the end of the day..." — say the actual point
- "It goes without saying..." — then don't say it
- "As previously mentioned..." — just say it again or don't

### 10. End with Action, Not Summary

Don't recap what you just said. The reader was there. End with what happens next: a decision needed, a deadline, an assignment, or a question.

- **Bad ending**: "In summary, by focusing on these key areas, we can drive meaningful improvements across the organization."
- **Good ending**: "I need a yes/no on the vendor by Friday so we can hit the April install window."

### Banned Phrases

- "In today's [anything]..."
- "It's not just about X — it's about Y"
- "At its core..."
- "This is where X comes in"
- "The reality is..."
- "Let's be honest..."  (unless you're genuinely about to be blunt)
- "Here's the thing..."  (same)
- "In an era of..."
- "More than just..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "X is a testament to Y"
- "First and foremost"
- "It goes without saying"
- "Needless to say"
- "In no uncertain terms"
- "Each and every"
- "Moving forward" (as a transition)
- "...highlighting the importance of..."
- "...showcasing [their/its/our] commitment to..."
- "...reflecting a broader trend..."
- "...underscoring the need for..."
- "...emphasizing the importance of..."
- "From [X] to [Y], from [A] to [B]" (false range — list the actual items)
- "Experts say..." / "Studies show..." / "Research suggests..." (without naming the source)
- "Despite these challenges, [X] continues to..." (challenge-triumph closer)

### Banned Structural Patterns

- **The triple-adjective stack**: "a dynamic, innovative, results-driven approach" — pick one adjective or zero
- **The false choice opener**: "In a world where X..." — start with the actual point
- **The em-dash sandwich**: overusing "X — and here's why — Y" more than once per page
- **Identical paragraph structure**: if three paragraphs in a row start with a topic sentence + three bullets + a concluding sentence, restructure
- **The compliment hedge**: "Great question!" or "That's an excellent point!" before answering — just answer
- **Superficial -ing participles**: tacking on present participles for false depth — "highlighting the importance of," "showcasing their commitment to," "reflecting a broader trend toward." These add zero information. Say what actually happened instead. "The redesign highlights their commitment to sustainability" → "The redesign uses recycled steel and cuts energy use 30%."
- **Copula avoidance**: AI consistently dodges "is" and "are" in favor of fancier verbs. "Serves as," "stands as," "represents," "boasts," "features," "offers" — when the sentence just means "is." "The gallery serves as the primary exhibition space" → "The gallery is LAAA's exhibition space." Just use "is."
- **Forced triads**: AI groups everything in threes — "innovation, collaboration, and excellence" / "strategy, execution, and culture." Real lists have as many items as there are items. Two is fine. Four is fine. Don't pad or compress to hit three.
- **Synonym cycling**: rotating synonyms for the same noun across consecutive sentences — "the protagonist faces challenges...the main character overcomes obstacles...the central figure triumphs." Pick one word and repeat it. Repetition is clearer than variety for variety's sake.
- **False ranges**: meaningless "from X to Y" constructions that gesture at breadth without saying anything — "from innovative startups to established enterprises," "from cutting-edge research to practical applications." Either list the actual items or state the scope concretely.
- **Unsourced authorities**: "Experts say," "Studies show," "Industry leaders agree," "Research suggests" — without naming the expert, study, or source. Either cite it specifically ("a 2024 McKinsey report found...") or drop the attribution and just state the claim.
- **The challenge-triumph ending**: "Despite these challenges, X continues to thrive / remains committed to excellence / looks toward a bright future." This is a formulaic closer that says nothing. End with a specific fact, a next step, or an honest assessment instead.

## Pre-Publish Checklist

Before finalizing any written output, run these checks:

- [ ] **First sentence test**: Does the opening sentence contain the actual point? No warm-up?
- [ ] **Aloud test**: Read the first three paragraphs out loud. Do they sound like a person talking?
- [ ] **Banned word scan**: Ctrl+F for every word on the banned list. Replace or cut each one.
- [ ] **Specificity check**: Are there at least 2 concrete details (numbers, names, dates, examples) per major claim?
- [ ] **Rhythm check**: Do sentence lengths vary? Are there at least 2 short sentences (<8 words) per section?
- [ ] **Hedge audit**: Count qualifiers ("potentially," "might," "could," "it's possible"). If more than 1 per paragraph, take a position.
- [ ] **Filler purge**: Can any sentence be deleted without losing meaning? Delete it.
- [ ] **Ending test**: Does the piece end with an action, decision, or question — not a summary?
- [ ] **Contraction check**: Are contractions used naturally? If not, add them.
- [ ] **Structural variety**: Do consecutive paragraphs have different structures (not all: statement → 3 bullets → wrap)?
- [ ] **-ing participle scan**: Search for "highlighting," "showcasing," "reflecting," "emphasizing," "underscoring." Replace with concrete statements.
- [ ] **Copula check**: Search for "serves as," "stands as," "represents." Replace with "is" where that's what you mean.
- [ ] **Triad audit**: Are lists forced into groups of three? Let them be whatever length is accurate.
- [ ] **Synonym cycling check**: Is the same noun called different things in consecutive sentences? Pick one and repeat it.
- [ ] **Attribution check**: Every "experts say" or "studies show" either gets a named source or gets dropped.

## Calibration Examples

### Email — Before (AI-sounding)

> Subject: Quarterly Performance Update and Strategic Recommendations
>
> Dear Team,
>
> I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to share some comprehensive insights regarding our quarterly performance metrics and outline several strategic recommendations that I believe could help us navigate the evolving landscape of our industry.
>
> It's worth noting that our team has demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of multifaceted challenges. The robust performance across key verticals is a testament to our collective commitment to excellence.
>
> Moving forward, I believe it would be beneficial to leverage our existing capabilities while exploring innovative approaches to streamline our operations.

### Email — After (Personal)

> Subject: Q1 results + 3 things to fix before Q2
>
> Team —
>
> Q1 revenue hit $14.2M, 6% above target. Installs drove it. Service lagged — down 11% vs. plan, mostly in CT and Long Island.
>
> Three things to fix now:
> 1. **CT booking rate** is 38%. Should be 55%+. Root cause: CSRs are quoting prices on the phone instead of booking diagnostics. Training update goes out Monday.
> 2. **LI tech utilization** dropped to 62%. Two open headcount are killing us. Offer letters go out this week or we pull from Westchester.
> 3. **Membership renewals** are stalling at the 90-day mark. Retention team is testing a new call script — results in 2 weeks.
>
> Q2 target is $16.1M. Achievable if we close these three gaps. Let me know if anything here doesn't match what you're seeing on the ground.

### Proposal — Before (AI-sounding)

> Our comprehensive suite of HVAC solutions is designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing infrastructure, leveraging cutting-edge technology to deliver transformative results. We are committed to fostering a collaborative partnership that empowers your team to unlock new levels of operational excellence.

### Proposal — After (Personal)

> We'll replace your two rooftop units and tie into your existing ductwork. No new penetrations, no structural work. The Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat units we're spec'ing handle -13°F without backup — which matters for your building since the boiler is on its last legs anyway.
>
> Total cost: $47,200 installed. We can start March 10 and you'll have heat and AC by March 28.
