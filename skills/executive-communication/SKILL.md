## Skill Layering

**Always apply the personal-writing skill underneath this skill.** The personal-writing rules (voice, banned words, rhythm, anti-AI patterns) are the base layer. This skill adds executive-specific structure (Pyramid Principle, SCQA, action titles, MECE) on top.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:
- Building board decks, investor updates, or leadership presentations
- Writing memos, one-pagers, or decision documents for executives
- Preparing L10 updates, rock reviews, or EOS artifacts for leadership
- Drafting proposals or recommendations for stakeholders director-level and above
- Creating any content where the audience's time is scarce and the stakes are high
- Michael asks for something "board-ready," "exec-ready," or "presentation-quality"

## Core Philosophy

Executive communication exists to drive decisions, not to display work. Every sentence, slide, and data point should answer one question: **"So what?"** If it doesn't change a decision or deepen understanding of something decision-relevant, cut it.

Executives don't read bottom-up. They read the headline, decide if the supporting logic holds, then move to the next point. Structure your communication the way they consume it — conclusion first, evidence underneath.

---

## Part 1: Structural Frameworks

### The Pyramid Principle (Minto)

**The rule**: You think bottom-up, but you present top-down.

Every piece of executive communication forms a pyramid:

```
         ┌─────────────────────┐
         │  Single Key Message  │  ← Answer / recommendation
         └──────────┬──────────┘
      ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
      ▼             ▼             ▼
┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│ Support 1│ │ Support 2│ │ Support 3│  ← Grouped arguments (MECE)
└─────┬────┘ └─────┬────┘ └─────┬────┘
   ┌──┼──┐      ┌──┼──┐      ┌──┼──┐
   ▼  ▼  ▼      ▼  ▼  ▼      ▼  ▼  ▼    ← Evidence / data
```

**How to apply it:**
1. State the answer or recommendation first
2. Group supporting arguments into 2-4 buckets (not 7, not 1)
3. Each bucket gets its own evidence layer
4. A reader who only reads level 1 should understand the recommendation. A reader who reads levels 1-2 should understand the logic. Level 3 is proof.

### SCQA Framework (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer)

Use SCQA to frame the opening of any executive communication. It builds urgency without being manipulative.

| Element | Purpose | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| **Situation** | Set context the audience already agrees with | Non-controversial. No new info here. |
| **Complication** | Introduce the tension or problem | This is why the audience should care right now |
| **Question** | The question the complication raises | Often implicit — can be stated or left unspoken |
| **Answer** | Your recommendation | This is the top of the pyramid |

**Example — board update:**

> **S**: We budgeted $16.1M revenue for Q2, driven by 340 install jobs across 4 brands.
> **C**: April bookings came in 22% below pace. CT and LI are the biggest gaps — both are running below 60% conversion on surveys.
> **Q**: (implicit: What do we do about it?)
> **A**: Three moves close the gap by June: (1) shift 2 LI crews to CT where demand is higher, (2) retrain CSRs on diagnostic-first booking, (3) launch the membership upsell campaign 4 weeks early.

**When to use full SCQA vs. just leading with the answer:**
- Full SCQA: When the audience doesn't yet know the problem exists, or when the recommendation is counterintuitive
- Answer-first only: When the audience already knows the problem and is waiting for your solution

### MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

Every grouping of arguments, options, or categories must be MECE:

- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlap between buckets. If a data point could fit in two categories, your categories are wrong.
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: Nothing important is left out. The buckets cover the full scope.

**Test it**: After you build your groupings, ask:
1. "Does any item belong in two buckets?" → If yes, redefine the buckets.
2. "Could someone raise a point that doesn't fit any bucket?" → If yes, you're missing a bucket.

**Common MECE structures:**

| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| Time-based | Short-term / medium-term / long-term |
| Process-based | Acquire / retain / grow |
| Stakeholder-based | Customers / employees / investors |
| Financial | Revenue / cost / capital |
| Internal/external | What we control / what we don't |

## Part 2: Format-Specific Rules

### Slide Decks (Board, Investor, Leadership)

#### Rule 1: Action Titles, Not Topic Titles

Every slide title is a complete sentence stating the slide's conclusion. If someone reads only the titles in sequence, they should understand your full argument.

| Topic Title (wrong) | Action Title (right) |
|---|---|
| Q1 Revenue Performance | Q1 revenue hit $14.2M, 6% above plan, driven by installs |
| Membership Update | Membership ARR grew 18% YoY but renewal rate dropped to 71% |
| Hiring Status | 3 of 5 open roles filled; LI tech and CT CSR are blockers |
| Market Opportunity | Northeast HVAC replacement market is $4.2B and growing 8% annually |
| Competitive Landscape | We're the only multi-brand platform in our ICP geography |
| Next Steps | Approve $2.1M Q2 marketing spend to capture peak summer demand |

**The partner-flip test**: A partner (or board member) flips through your 30-slide deck reading only titles. Do they get the full story? If any title is a label instead of a conclusion, fix it.

#### Rule 2: One Message Per Slide

If you can't state the slide's point in one sentence, you have two slides. Split it.

- One chart per slide, not three
- One recommendation per slide, not a list of five
- White space improves comprehension. Don't fill space just because it's there.

#### Rule 3: The Body Proves the Title

Everything on the slide supports the action title. Apply the "so what" test: point at any element and ask "so what?" If it doesn't connect to the title's claim, remove it.

- Source every number. Unsourced data destroys credibility.
- Prefer charts over tables when showing trends. Use tables when the audience needs to look up specific values.
- Labels > legends. Put the label on the data point, not in a separate legend box.

#### Rule 4: The 60-Second Rule

Each slide should be absorbed in under 60 seconds. This is a design constraint, not a presentation tip. If it takes longer, the slide is too complex.

#### Rule 5: Slide Sequence = Argument Structure

The deck flows like a structured argument:

```
1. SCQA opening (1-2 slides)
2. Executive summary / recommendation (1 slide)
3. Supporting argument 1 + evidence (2-4 slides)
4. Supporting argument 2 + evidence (2-4 slides)
5. Supporting argument 3 + evidence (2-4 slides)
6. Risks / considerations (1 slide)
7. Ask / next steps / decision needed (1 slide)
8. Appendix (unlimited — backup detail)
```

Appendix slides are not optional filler. They're where you prove you've done the work without cluttering the main argument. Anticipate the top 5 questions and put the answers in the appendix before anyone asks.

### Memos & Decision Documents

#### The Amazon Model (Adapted)

For complex topics requiring deep analysis, use narrative format — not bullets. The memo forces the writer to think in complete logical chains rather than hiding gaps behind bullet points.

**Structure:**

| Section | Purpose | Length Guide |
|---|---|---|
| **Opening / SCQA** | Frame the problem and recommendation | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Goals** | What success looks like, with metrics | 3-5 bullet points, SMART format |
| **Tenets** | Guiding principles for this decision | 2-4 principles, each one sentence |
| **Current State** | Data snapshot — where things stand now | 1-2 paragraphs + supporting data |
| **Options Considered** | What you evaluated and why you rejected alternatives | 1 paragraph per option |
| **Recommendation** | The chosen path with implementation detail | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Risks & Mitigations** | What could go wrong and your plan for it | Table format preferred |
| **Ask** | What you need from the reader (approval, resources, decision) | 1-3 bullet points |

**Key rules:**
- Write in complete sentences and paragraphs, not bullet-point outlines
- Every claim gets a source or data point
- State what you rejected and why — this is where credibility is built
- The ask must be specific: "Approve $X by [date]" not "Consider investing in this area"

#### One-Pagers (Quick Decisions)

For simpler decisions or status updates:

```
[Action Title — one sentence stating the recommendation]

Context: [2-3 sentences — the SCQA compressed]

Recommendation: [What you want done, by whom, by when]

Key data:
• [Metric 1]: [value] — [so what]
• [Metric 2]: [value] — [so what]
• [Metric 3]: [value] — [so what]

Risks: [1-2 sentences on what could go wrong]

Ask: [Specific decision or approval needed]
```

### Executive Emails & Updates

#### The 3-Line Rule

An executive should understand your email in three lines or fewer. Structure:

1. **Line 1**: What you need (decision, awareness, or action)
2. **Line 2**: The key fact or context
3. **Line 3**: The deadline or next step

Then add detail below if needed — but the first three lines must stand alone.

**Example:**
> Need approval on the Q2 marketing budget ($2.1M) by Friday.
>
> We're 22% below booking pace — this spend targets the gap in CT and LI with direct mail + Google LSA.
>
> Deck attached. Happy to walk through it but the recommendation is on slide 2.

#### Status Updates (Weekly/Monthly)

Use the **traffic light format** — executives scan for red/yellow, skip green:

```
🟢 On track: [1 sentence — what's working]
🟡 Watch: [1 sentence — what's at risk + your plan]
🔴 Needs help: [1 sentence — what's blocked + specific ask]
```

Every item gets one sentence, not a paragraph. The detail goes in the attached report.

## Part 3: The "So What" Discipline

### The Three-Layer Test

For every data point, claim, or insight, apply three layers:

| Layer | Question | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **What** | What happened? | "CT conversion dropped to 38%." |
| **So What** | Why does it matter? | "That's $420K in lost revenue this quarter." |
| **Now What** | What do we do? | "CSR retraining starts Monday. Target: 55% by month-end." |

If you can't get past "What," the data point doesn't belong in executive communication. If you stop at "So What," you've identified a problem without a plan — which annoys executives. Always get to "Now What."

### Activities vs. Outcomes

Executives don't care what you did. They care what changed.

| Activity (don't lead with this) | Outcome (lead with this) |
|---|---|
| "We held 14 sales training sessions" | "Close rate improved from 28% to 35% after training" |
| "We migrated to the new CRM" | "Lead response time dropped from 4 hours to 12 minutes" |
| "We interviewed 20 candidates" | "3 offers extended, 2 accepted, start dates confirmed" |
| "We analyzed customer feedback" | "Top 3 complaints identified — fix for #1 ships next week" |

### Quantify or Don't Claim

If you can't put a number on it, qualify the claim honestly. Executives distrust unquantified assertions.

- **Bad**: "Revenue improved significantly"
- **Acceptable**: "Revenue grew 11% QoQ"
- **Best**: "Revenue grew 11% QoQ ($1.4M), driven by 23% increase in install jobs. Service revenue was flat."

## Part 4: Common Mistakes Checklist

Before finalizing any executive deliverable, check for these failure modes:

### Structure Failures
- [ ] Burying the lead — recommendation isn't in the first paragraph or first slide after SCQA
- [ ] Topic titles on slides instead of action titles
- [ ] Arguments aren't MECE — overlapping categories or missing a key bucket
- [ ] Bottom-up ordering — building to the conclusion instead of starting with it

### Content Failures
- [ ] Data without interpretation — charts presented without "so what"
- [ ] Activities reported instead of outcomes
- [ ] Unsourced numbers — any quantitative claim without attribution
- [ ] Unsubstantiated projections — forecasts without stated assumptions
- [ ] Ignoring competition or alternatives — not showing what was considered and rejected

### Audience Failures
- [ ] Internal jargon — acronyms, project names, or technical terms the audience doesn't use
- [ ] Deck doing double duty — trying to be both a live presentation and a standalone read
- [ ] No clear ask — the audience finishes and doesn't know what decision is needed
- [ ] Surprising the leadership team — presenting something the CEO or direct reports haven't previewed

### Format Failures
- [ ] Information overload — more than one message per slide, more than 5 bullets per point
- [ ] Wall of text — paragraphs on slides (save narrative for memos)
- [ ] Missing appendix — no backup for anticipated questions
- [ ] No page numbers or headers — executives can't reference specific slides in discussion

## Part 5: Pre-Publish Checklist

Run these checks before sending any executive deliverable:

- [ ] **Pyramid test**: Does the document have a single top-level message? Can you state it in one sentence?
- [ ] **Title-skim test** (decks): Read only the slide titles in sequence. Does the full argument come through?
- [ ] **SCQA check**: Is there a clear Situation → Complication → Answer arc in the opening?
- [ ] **MECE check**: Are all groupings non-overlapping and complete?
- [ ] **"So What" sweep**: For every data point, can you state the implication and next action?
- [ ] **Outcome vs. activity audit**: Are you leading with results, not tasks performed?
- [ ] **Quantification check**: Is every claim supported by a number? Are assumptions stated?
- [ ] **Source check**: Is every number attributed?
- [ ] **Ask clarity**: Does the audience know exactly what decision or action you need from them?
- [ ] **Jargon sweep**: Would someone outside your team understand every term?
- [ ] **60-second test** (decks): Can each slide be absorbed in under a minute?
- [ ] **Banned word scan**: Run against the personal-writing skill's banned list — no "leverage," "robust," "comprehensive," "streamline," etc. Board decks and investor emails are where these sneak in most.
- [ ] **Preview check**: Has the relevant leadership seen this before it goes to a wider audience?

## Calibration Examples

### Board Slide — Before (Topic Title, No "So What")

**Title**: Q1 Membership Performance

- Total members: 4,200
- New members: 380
- Cancellations: 210
- Net change: +170
- Revenue: $2.1M

### Board Slide — After (Action Title, Interpreted)

**Title**: Membership ARR grew 8% in Q1 but renewal rate decline signals a Q3 risk

- **ARR**: $8.4M → $9.1M (+8% QoQ). New member acquisition up 15% from direct mail campaign.
- **Renewal rate**: Dropped from 78% to 71%. Root cause: 90-day cohort churn — members who joined via Angi leads cancel 2.3x more than organic.
- **Risk**: If renewal rate holds at 71%, we miss the $10M year-end target by $600K.
- **Fix in progress**: Retention team testing new 60-day check-in call. Pilot results in 3 weeks.

### Investor Email — Before (Buried Lead)

> Hi all,
>
> Hope everyone is doing well. Wanted to send a quick update on how things have been going. The team has been really busy this quarter working on a number of initiatives across our portfolio brands. We've been focused on improving operational efficiency, growing our membership base, and continuing to evaluate acquisition targets. There's a lot of exciting progress to share...

### Investor Email — After (3-Line Rule)

> Q1 update: $14.2M revenue (6% above plan), 2 LOIs signed, membership ARR at $9.1M.
>
> Biggest risk: CT and LI conversion rates are dragging — action plan attached. Everything else is green or ahead.
>
> Full deck attached (12 slides). Board meeting is April 15. Let me know if you want to discuss anything beforehand.

### Decision Memo — Before (Activity-Focused)

> **Subject: CRM Migration Update**
>
> The team has been working hard on evaluating CRM options over the past several weeks. We conducted demos with Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive. We also interviewed 8 internal stakeholders and reviewed integration requirements with the IT team. Additionally, we created a scoring matrix and held two review sessions...

### Decision Memo — After (Outcome + Ask)

> **Subject: CRM decision — recommend Pipedrive, need approval by Friday**
>
> **Recommendation**: Pipedrive. $38K/year, live in 4 weeks, covers 100% of our pipeline tracking needs.
>
> **Why not the others**: Salesforce ($142K/yr, 12-week implementation — overkill for our stage). HubSpot ($67K/yr — weaker ServiceTitan integration, would need custom middleware).
>
> **Key data**: Pipedrive scored highest on integration speed, cost, and CSR usability in our eval matrix (attached). 6 of 8 stakeholders ranked it #1.
>
> **Risk**: Pipedrive's reporting is weaker than Salesforce. Mitigation: we'll run dashboards in BigQuery, which we already do.
>
> **Ask**: Approve the $38K annual spend so we can start implementation Monday.
