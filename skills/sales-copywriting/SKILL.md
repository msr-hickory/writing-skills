## Skill Layering

**Always apply the personal-writing skill underneath this skill.** The personal-writing rules (voice, banned words, rhythm, anti-AI patterns) are the base layer. This skill adds customer-facing-specific structure (direct response frameworks, awareness-level matching, VoC discipline, trust architecture) on top.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:
- Writing direct mail pieces, postcards, or printed marketing materials
- Creating landing pages, service pages, or web copy
- Drafting email campaigns (drip sequences, promotional, reactivation)
- Writing ad copy (Google LSA, PPC, social, display)
- Building customer proposals, estimates, or follow-up communications
- Creating membership or maintenance plan marketing
- Writing any content where the goal is a customer taking action (calling, booking, buying)

---

## Core Philosophy

Sales copy exists to get one person to take one action. Not to inform. Not to impress. Not to "build awareness." Every sentence either moves the reader toward that action or it doesn't belong.

The best sales copy sounds like a knowledgeable friend giving advice — not a corporation broadcasting a message. It uses the customer's own language, addresses their actual fears, and makes the next step obvious and easy.

## Part 1: Frameworks — When to Use What

### Framework Selection Matrix

| Situation | Framework | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Customer knows they have a problem, shopping for solutions | **PAS** (Problem-Agitate-Solve) | Meets them at the pain point, builds urgency |
| Cold audience, introducing Hickory or a new service | **AIDA** (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action) | Builds awareness before asking for anything |
| Proposal or estimate follow-up | **BAB** (Before-After-Bridge) | Paints the transformation, then shows the path |
| Membership / maintenance plan pitch | **4 P's** (Picture-Promise-Proof-Push) | Selling a future state + ongoing relationship |
| Emergency / urgent service | **Direct CTA** | Skip the frameworks — state availability, build trust fast, give the number |

### PAS — Problem, Agitate, Solve

Best for: service pages, Google Ads, direct mail to problem-aware audiences.

**Structure:**
1. **Problem** — Name the specific pain. Use the customer's language, not industry jargon.
2. **Agitate** — Make the consequences of inaction concrete. What gets worse? What does it cost?
3. **Solve** — Present your service as the fix. Be specific about what they get.

**Example — duct replacement direct mail:**

> **Your energy bills shouldn't be this high.** *(Problem)*
>
> If your home was built before 2005, there's a good chance your ductwork is leaking 25-40% of the air you're paying to heat and cool. That's $1,200-$2,000 a year going into your walls and attic. And it gets worse every winter as the seals degrade. *(Agitate)*
>
> We test your duct system in 45 minutes and show you exactly where the leaks are — no guessing, no upsell. If replacement makes sense, we quote it on the spot. Average payback: 18 months in energy savings alone. *(Solve)*
>
> **Call [number] or book online at [URL]. Free duct assessment through March 31.**

### AIDA — Attention, Interest, Desire, Action

Best for: brand introduction, cold audiences, new market entry, social media.

**Structure:**
1. **Attention** — A headline that stops the scroll. Lead with a surprising fact, a bold claim, or a question that hits a nerve.
2. **Interest** — Give them a reason to keep reading. New information, a story, or a reframe.
3. **Desire** — Make them want the outcome. Specifics, social proof, and imagery.
4. **Action** — One clear CTA. Make it easy. Remove friction.

**Example — new market introduction email:**

> **Subject: Your HVAC company is about to change (for the better)**
>
> You've built something real — a company your customers trust and your techs take pride in. But growth means choosing between doing more yourself or finding a partner who gets it. *(Attention)*
>
> Hickory is the Northeast's HVAC platform. We partner with owner-operators to handle the back office — finance, marketing, recruiting, technology — so you can focus on what you're best at: the work and the customer. *(Interest)*
>
> Our partners keep their brand, their team, and their reputation. They get access to $2M+ in annual purchasing power, AI-powered scheduling, and a central support team that actually answers the phone. *(Desire)*
>
> **If you've been thinking about your next chapter, let's talk. 30 minutes, no pitch deck. [Book a call →]** *(Action)*

### BAB — Before, After, Bridge

Best for: proposals, estimate follow-ups, case studies, testimonials.

**Structure:**
1. **Before** — The customer's current reality (the pain or inconvenience they live with)
2. **After** — What life looks like once the problem is solved
3. **Bridge** — Your service is the bridge between the two states

**Example — estimate follow-up email:**

> Right now you're running two window units and a 22-year-old furnace. Your second floor is 8 degrees warmer than your first in summer, and your January gas bills hit $480. *(Before)*
>
> After the install, you'll have consistent temps floor to floor, a system that handles -13°F without backup heat, and energy costs that drop 35-40%. Plus a 12-year parts and labor warranty. *(After)*
>
> The Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat system we spec'd does all of this. Installed in 3 days, fully operational by next Friday. The $47,200 quote is locked through the end of the month. *(Bridge)*
>
> **Ready to move forward? Reply to this email or call [number].**

## Part 2: Awareness-Level Matching (Schwartz)

Every piece of copy must be calibrated to the reader's awareness level. Writing product-level copy for a problem-aware audience kills conversion. Writing educational copy for a most-aware audience wastes their time.

### The Five Levels

| Level | Customer Thinking | Your Job | Copy Approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Unaware** | "Everything's fine" | Create awareness that a problem exists | Lead with a surprising fact or story. Don't sell. Educate. |
| **2. Problem Aware** | "Something's wrong but I don't know what to do" | Validate the problem, introduce solutions | Name the pain in their words. Show you understand. Hint at the fix. |
| **3. Solution Aware** | "I know solutions exist, researching options" | Position your approach as the best path | Differentiate. Why your method vs. alternatives? |
| **4. Product Aware** | "I know about you, comparing you to competitors" | Overcome objections, prove superiority | Social proof, guarantees, head-to-head comparisons, specific outcomes |
| **5. Most Aware** | "I'm ready, just need a reason to act now" | Give the final push | Offer, deadline, urgency, make it frictionless |

### Matching Awareness to Format

| Format | Typical Awareness Level | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Blog / content marketing | 1-2 (Unaware → Problem Aware) | "5 Signs Your HVAC System Is Costing You Money" |
| Google search ads | 2-3 (Problem → Solution Aware) | "AC Not Cooling? Same-Day Diagnosis. Licensed & Insured." |
| Direct mail to existing customers | 4-5 (Product → Most Aware) | "Your system is 12 years old. Here's your upgrade offer." |
| Retargeting ads | 4 (Product Aware) | "Still thinking about it? Here's what 200+ homeowners said." |
| Proposal / estimate | 4-5 (Product → Most Aware) | Specific system, price, timeline, warranty |
| Membership renewal | 5 (Most Aware) | "Your plan renews March 1. Lock in this year's rate." |

### Common Mistake: Awareness Mismatch

Most marketing teams write all copy at level 4-5 (product-focused). This ignores the 80% of potential customers at levels 1-3. Map your content calendar to cover all five levels.

---

## Part 3: Voice of Customer (VoC) Discipline

### The Rule

The best copy comes from customer language, not from a copywriter's imagination. Before writing any marketing piece, mine VoC data first.

### Where to Find VoC Data

| Source | What to Look For |
|---|---|
| **Google/Yelp reviews** (yours + competitors) | Exact phrases customers use to describe problems, outcomes, and feelings |
| **ServiceTitan call recordings** | How customers describe their issue when they first call |
| **Sales call notes / Pipedrive** | Objections, questions, decision criteria |
| **Technician field notes** | What customers say during the visit |
| **Social media / Nextdoor / Reddit** | Unfiltered complaints and recommendations about HVAC |
| **Customer surveys** | Post-install and post-service feedback |
| **Cancellation reasons** | Why membership or service customers leave |

### How to Use VoC Data

1. **Mine**: Collect 20-50 customer quotes about the topic you're writing about
2. **Cluster**: Group by theme (price concern, comfort, trust, speed, quality)
3. **Rank**: Identify the 2-3 dominant themes
4. **Mirror**: Use actual customer phrasing in headlines, bullets, and CTAs
5. **Validate**: Test the copy against another batch of customer language to check resonance

### VoC Mirroring Examples

| What a copywriter might write | What the customer actually said | Use the customer's version |
|---|---|---|
| "Experience optimal indoor climate control" | "I just want my house to be the same temperature everywhere" | "Same temperature on every floor. That's what this system does." |
| "Our certified technicians provide reliable service" | "The guy actually showed up on time and explained what he was doing" | "On time. Explains what he's doing. Cleans up after. That's the standard." |
| "Invest in energy-efficient HVAC solutions" | "My gas bill was $500 last month, that can't be right" | "If your gas bill hit $500, it's not the utility's fault — it's the system." |

---

## Part 4: Trust Architecture

For HVAC and home services, trust is the conversion bottleneck. Customers are letting strangers into their home and spending $5K-$50K+ on something they can't evaluate themselves. Every piece of copy must build trust systematically.

### The Trust Stack

Layer these into every customer-facing piece. Not all at once — select the right ones for the format and awareness level.

| Trust Signal | Where to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Specificity** | Everywhere | "$47,200 installed" beats "competitive pricing" |
| **Social proof** (reviews/ratings) | Landing pages, ads, direct mail | "4.9 stars, 847 reviews on Google" |
| **Named testimonials** | Service pages, proposals | "'They replaced our entire system in 2 days. Zero issues.' — Sarah K., Westchester" |
| **Certifications / licenses** | Footer, about page, proposals | "EPA-certified, NATE-certified, fully licensed and insured in NY, CT, and NJ" |
| **Guarantees** | Proposals, service pages, ads | "100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not happy, we come back — free." |
| **Transparency** | Pricing pages, estimates | "No hidden fees. The quote is the price." |
| **Longevity** | Brand messaging | "Serving Westchester since 1987" |
| **Process visibility** | Service descriptions | "Here's exactly what happens when you call..." |
| **Team visibility** | About pages, direct mail | Photo + name + credential of the tech or salesperson |

### Trust Killers to Avoid

- Stock photos of models pretending to be technicians
- Vague claims without numbers ("industry-leading," "best-in-class")
- Missing or hidden pricing (forces customers to call, which many won't)
- No reviews or testimonials visible
- Generic "Contact Us" CTAs with no specificity about what happens next

---

## Part 5: CTA Rules

Every piece of sales copy ends with one clear call to action. Not three. Not "contact us or visit our website or follow us on social media." One.

### CTA Design Principles

| Principle | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Specificity** | Say exactly what happens when they act | "Book your free duct assessment" not "Contact us" |
| **Low friction** | Remove barriers — no forms if a phone number works | "Call or text [number]" |
| **Urgency** (when real) | Only use deadlines that are true | "Quote locked through March 31" |
| **Outcome framing** | Frame the CTA as getting the result, not doing work | "Get your quote" not "Request a consultation" |
| **Repetition** | Repeat the CTA 2-3x in longer pieces | Top, middle (after proof), and end |

### CTA Examples by Format

| Format | CTA |
|---|---|
| Direct mail | "Call [number] for your free assessment. Mention code SPRING26." |
| Landing page | "Book Online — Pick Your Time" [button] |
| Email campaign | "Reply YES to this email and we'll call you within the hour." |
| Google ad | "Same-Day Service. Call Now." |
| Proposal follow-up | "Ready to lock in the March price? Reply or call [name] direct at [number]." |
| Membership pitch | "Join the comfort plan → $29/month. Cancel anytime." |

## Part 6: Format Templates

### Direct Mail Piece (Postcard / Letter)

```
OUTER: Teaser headline that creates curiosity or states a benefit
       (NOT your company name — that goes on the back/bottom)

INSIDE/BODY:
1. Opening hook — PAS or AIDA opener (2-3 sentences)
2. The offer — What you're providing, specific and concrete
3. Social proof — 1-2 testimonials or review stats
4. Trust signals — License, guarantee, years in business
5. CTA — Phone number, URL, QR code. One primary action.
6. Deadline — If applicable, when the offer expires

DESIGN: Photo of real work (not stock). Logo small/bottom.
        Phone number large. QR code to booking page.
```

### Landing Page

```
ABOVE THE FOLD:
- Headline: Benefit or pain point (from VoC data)
- Subheadline: Specificity — what, where, how fast
- CTA button: Action-oriented, outcome-framed
- Trust bar: Stars, review count, certifications

BODY:
- Problem section (2-3 sentences, customer language)
- Solution section (what you do, how it works, 3 steps max)
- Social proof section (3-5 testimonials, named, with specifics)
- FAQ section (address top 3-5 objections)

BOTTOM:
- CTA repeat
- Phone number
- Service area
```

### Email Campaign (3-Touch Drip)

```
Email 1 (Day 0): Problem + empathy. No hard sell. End with soft CTA.
Email 2 (Day 3): Solution + social proof. Medium CTA with specifics.
Email 3 (Day 7): Urgency + offer. Hard CTA with deadline.

Every email:
- Subject line: <50 chars, specific, no clickbait
- Preview text: Extends the subject, doesn't repeat it
- From name: A person's name, not company name
- Body: 150 words max per email. Scannable.
- CTA: One per email. Linked text or button, not both.
```

## Part 7: Pre-Publish Checklist

Before finalizing any sales copy:

- [ ] **Awareness match**: Is the copy calibrated to where this audience actually is on the Schwartz scale?
- [ ] **VoC check**: Does the copy use customer language? Can you trace key phrases to actual customer quotes?
- [ ] **One-action test**: Is there exactly one CTA? Is it specific about what happens next?
- [ ] **Trust audit**: Are there at least 3 trust signals (specificity, social proof, guarantee, certification, transparency)?
- [ ] **"So what" sweep**: For every feature mentioned, is there a corresponding benefit stated?
- [ ] **Jargon scan**: Would a homeowner with zero HVAC knowledge understand every word?
- [ ] **Specificity check**: Are there real numbers (price, timeline, savings, review count) — not vague claims?
- [ ] **Stock photo purge**: Are all images of real work, real teams, real equipment?
- [ ] **Urgency authenticity**: Is every deadline or scarcity claim actually true?
- [ ] **Mobile readability**: Will this render well on a phone screen (for digital)?
- [ ] **Banned word check**: Run against the personal-writing-SKILL.md banned list — no "leverage," "robust," etc.
