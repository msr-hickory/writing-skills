  Structured idea evaluation using Trusted Advisor principles. Use when
  the user wants honest, multi-dimensional feedback on a business idea,
  strategy, product concept, or initiative — not just brainstorming
  exploration. Triggers: "give me feedback on", "what do you think of",
  "poke holes in", "evaluate this idea", "is this a good idea",
  "what am I missing", "challenge this"

# Idea Feedback

Structured idea evaluation that earns the right to critique by listening first, steel-manning second, then giving an honest recommendation. Based on David Maister's Trusted Advisor framework.

## When to Use vs. Brainstorming

**Brainstorming** clarifies WHAT to build when requirements are vague — it explores.
**Idea-feedback** evaluates a specific idea that already exists — it critiques.

Use this skill when:
- The user has a proposal and wants honest assessment, not exploration
- The user says "what do you think of...", "poke holes in...", "is this a good idea?"
- The user wants to stress-test an idea before committing resources

Skip this skill when:
- Requirements are vague and need clarification (use brainstorming)
- The user wants to explore multiple directions (use brainstorming)
- The task is a straightforward execution request

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Listen & Understand

Earn the right to frame before critiquing. Ask clarifying questions first — don't jump to evaluation.

**Understand:**
- What problem does this solve? For whom? Why now?
- What's the core bet? What has to be true for this to work?
- What's the user's confidence level — are they excited or hedging?

**Listen for what's unsaid** — what concerns does the user have that they haven't voiced?

**Restate the idea back:** "So the core bet is..." — confirm understanding before proceeding.

**Exit condition:** Proceed when you can articulate the idea better than it was stated to you.

### Phase 2: Steel Man

Present the strongest version of the idea — better than the user articulated it.

- Identify genuine strengths: what's right about this, what's novel, what's well-timed.
- "If everything goes right, here's how this wins: ..."
- Articulate the best-case scenario concretely: who benefits, by how much, by when.

This earns the right to critique. If you can't articulate WHY the idea might work, you haven't understood it yet. Go back to Phase 1.

### Phase 3: Structured Critique

Evaluate across relevant lenses. Rate each High / Medium / Low confidence:

| Lens | Key question |
|------|-------------|
| **Market** | Is there real demand, or are we assuming it? |
| **Operational** | Can we actually execute this with current capabilities? |
| **Financial** | Do the unit economics work? What's the payback period? |
| **Strategic fit** | Does this strengthen or dilute our position? |
| **Risk** | What's the downside scenario, and can we survive it? |

For each applicable lens:
- State the honest assessment (not "it depends")
- Identify the weakest assumption
- Name the specific risk

Not all lenses apply to every idea. Skip irrelevant ones rather than forcing analysis.

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Recommendation

- **Name it and claim it**: State the single biggest concern plainly. "The thing that worries me most is..."
- **Pre-mortem**: "If this fails in 12 months, the most likely reason is..."
- **Bottom line** — one of:
  - "Strong idea, execute."
  - "Promising, but needs X before committing."
  - "I'd recommend against this because..."
- **If recommending against**: Suggest what to do instead, or what would need to be true to change the assessment.
- **Next steps**: What's the cheapest way to test the key assumption before committing fully?

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't critique before understanding (Phase 1 is mandatory)
- Don't give balanced "on the other hand" analysis when you have a clear view — have a point of view
- Don't soften a fatal flaw — if the unit economics don't work, say so
- Don't manufacture critique for strong ideas just to seem balanced
- Don't be contrarian for sport — the goal is to improve the idea, not demonstrate cleverness
- Don't bury the recommendation in caveats — if you think it's a bad idea, lead with that
